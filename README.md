# openstreet-maps


CampusMap is a console app that helps the user navigate UIC's campus. The project uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest weighted path from a given starting location to a given ending location. This project is based on OpenStreetMap to navigate through the UIC campus, and uses TinyXML to parse the .xml files.
